# MazeSolver
Final project for my Data Structures &amp; Algorithms class

This is a simple maze solving program that I made in May of 2016 for a class project. It was my first time messing with GUI components and I was quite proud of this at the time. As per the specifications, the "Mouse" is to be placed in any location within the maze. Any open cell on the outer border of the maze is considered an "exit". The input file is as follows:
    The first line has 2 integers, W and H, which are the width and height.
    The next H lines contain W integers, either a 0 or a 1. A 1 represents a wall, while a 0 represents an open cell.
